### Research Experience

**Harvard University Pre-College - Summer 2020**
- Took two courses on oncology: "Introduction to Cancer: Diving into Research"
and "Molecular Oncology: Unravelling Molecular Biology Techniques" with Dr.
Julie Konge.
- In the first course, I learned about the basics of cancer such as apoptosis, tumor
angiogenesis, the p53 tumor supressor, and the difference between malignant
and benign tumors.
- In the second course, I worked with real case studies to identify the severity of
cancers and their inheritance patterns.

**Pediatric Internship at Stanford University - Summer 2021**
- Spent 15 hours a week working on research project and 5 hours a week on
professional development, networking, research practices, and college
applications workshops.
- Learned RStudio coding for bioinformatic analyses.
- Worked with the Gawad Lab and a partner to develop a research poster on
clonal hematopoesis and mutated XAF1 and TP53 alleles in a Brazilian family.
